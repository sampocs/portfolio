## Historical Exports

### Vanguard

- Only 18 months is available for download, fortunately I had the older data in my spreadsheet already
- The last 18 months was obtained by going to "Activity" -> "Download" -> "Download as CSV"
- The first few sections in the CSV that had the total portfolio value were removed manually from the CSV

### Coinbase

- Go to https://accounts.coinbase.com/statements
- Enter a date range to encapsulate all trades
- Select CSV and download
- Then the first few metadata rows of the CSV were manually removed so that it started with the main headers
